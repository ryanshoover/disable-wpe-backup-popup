Disables the standard prompt on WP Engine asking \"Did you backup first?\" when updating plugins / core / etc.

## Description
WordPress will "nag" you to backup your site before you install or update plugins,  themes, or core. This is great in production sites, but a little annoying in development sites or sites where the daily backup is sufficient.

Install & activate this plugin and watch that "nag" box disappear.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin to `wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin
